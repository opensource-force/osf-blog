            <h2 id="an-open-invitation-to-the-advancement">An open invitation to The Advancement</h2>
<p>I've been working on solving the problem of advertising and digital identity for close to a decade.
I've released things in fits and starts just trying to get people on board with the idea of not putting their birthdays into random online forms.
But the road to progress is always winding.</p>
<p>Then on January 20th, four smiling billionaires, two nazi salutes, and the subsequent fellating of these dickheads by "entrepreneurs," and wallstreet bros, gave a very simple entry point into doing something.</p>
<p>This isn't a political thing, and it isn't an American thing.
Regardless of who you are, wanting a world where your every online action isn't spied upon shouldn't be controversial.</p>
<p>So let's focus on that for like a year.
We'll be back to fighting about politics soon enough, but before that let's take these billionaires down a peg.</p>
<p>I call the group who does this, The Advancemet, and everyone, except for actual nazis, are invited.
All you have to do is install a browser extension, and/or download an app.
Those of us in The Advancement who make those things, will take it from there.
And you can spend your time doing whatever you love to do, and not have to worry about billionaires in your bedroom.</p>
<h3 id="i-want-to-get-involved">I want to get involved</h3>
<p>Have you ever started a movement?
Neither have I, but I have joined some clubs, so let's start there.</p>
<p>Here's how you join a club, it's nice because it works the same as the bar: you show up.</p>
<p>And then to get involved...well I'll let Captain Ron explain how it works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr82gPYI24I&amp;t=180s"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/tr82gPYI24I/0.jpg" alt="Captain Ron gives a new sailor an incentive" /></a></p>
<p>You just start doing stuff.
It doesn't matter if its small, or special, or crucial, or anything.
Just start doing stuff with the club, because the point isn't that one thing, the point for the club, in Ron's case here the crew, is to get the boat all the way to where it's going, and that's a long-term goal.</p>
<h2 id="getting-on-the-boat">Getting on the boat</h2>
<p>When I was a kid, anthropologists were still saying we didn't know how humans got all the way to remote islands like Hawaii, and Easter Island.</p>
<p>But I knew.</p>
<p>Someone built a boat.
And then that person said, "I'm heading that way, who's coming with me?"
And somehow enough people joined that person on their boat that when they got to Hawaii they didn't die immediately.</p>
<p>Centuries after these explorers ventured forth, I sat at a bar with my friend where someone posited that we would never go to Mars because who would risk that flight.
I said ridiculous!
Why?</p>
<p>Because we should never understimate humanity's desire to get on the boat.</p>
<p>For the past decade I've been building a boat.
It floats, but it still needs some work.
But the volcano in the middle of the island is rumbling, and threatening to pour nazis down its sides, and so we've got to get on the water soon.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep building the boat one way or another.
If you want to help, you just have to come aboard.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do that until the end of February or so, is going to be to join us on discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/M5V8Xwm">https://discord.gg/M5V8Xwm</a>.</p>
<p>Or email me at zach at planetnine.app -- that one still works for now ðŸ™‚</p>
<br>
<p><strong>There's room for everyone in the revolution friend.
I hope to see you aboard.</strong></p>
