Le Guin's fantastic A Wizard of Earthsea creates a world of magic where the greatest power one can hold over a person or thing is knowledge of its true name.\nA friend of mine and I were lamenting that we never had the opportunity to run in to Le Guin while we were all in Portland (he's a big deal enough that this was a possibility, I am not).\nHe also shared with me her essay on The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction.\nThose of you familiar with Planet Nine's lore will know that boats feature quite heavily.\nBoats have two properties that make them useful: they float, and they carry things from here to there.\nIf we relax our definition of floating to include being carried, I hope you'll indulge me in acknowledging that the carrier bag, and the boat have much in common.\n(I'd like to note too that Le Guinn acknowledges the importance of stacks in her essay, \"home being another, larger\nkind of pouch or bag, a container for people.\"\nAnyone who has been drinking with me as I try to explain stacks and boats will recognize this flexibility in terminology)\nThe gist of the theory, which comes from Elizabeth Fisher's Carrier Bag Theory of Human Evolution, is that though bags [and boats] are essential to humans, so much so that they were likely our earliest tool, they don't fit in well with the conflict-driven hero narratives of modern fiction.\nHero worship is not just in fiction, but I would say permeates all of popular culture in the United States--whether quarterback, or diva, or pedophile-turned-president--whereas carrier bags are things you get when you donate twenty bucks to PBS, which normally you wouldn't do, but now you have to because of that stupid president.\nLe Guin writes in her essay:\n\nOne relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of\nconflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have\nread a how-to-write manual that said, \"A story should be seen as a\nbattle,\" and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict,\ncompetition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as\ncarrier bag I belly I box I house I medicine bundle, may be seen as\nnecessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized\neither as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.\n\n\nFinally, it's clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He\nneeds a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and\nhe looks like a rabbit, like a potato.\n\nThis notion of narrative as a continuing process is intriguing.\nAren't stories, by definition, in possession of an ending?\nBut robbed of the need for resolution, why not just go on and on?\nPeople haven't been writing computer programs nearly as long as we've been writing stories so we don't really know what we're doing yet, and it's probably unfair to map the latter to the former.\nBut I don't think it's too far afield to say that the world of Facebook and Google has it's own hero-fetish that might not be the greatest when the story doesn't end.\n\"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain,\" Harvey Dent was on to something.\nIf the gigantocorps are our heroes, constantly on stage peacocking about like the world owes them for their benevolence, what's the carrier bag for tech?\nOn Earthsea we would only have to speak its name to avail ourselves of its power.\nHere on plain old Earth we need that name, and then we have to build it.\nWe have an idea of what it might be.\nWe call it a base.\nBillions and billions\nWhen the interwebs was kicking off the dotcom boom, there were six billion or so people on the planet.\nTwenty-six years later there are eight billion.\nIn real life, we call this increase a triumph of modern medicine, in the biz we call it a scaling problem.\nIf you want to bore yourself nauseous for an hour, go look up system design interview prep where some dude from a faang (this acronym is for Facebook (now Meta), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now Alphabet). Originally Netflix, whose market cap is a fraction of the others, was included so as to avoid the unfortunate F-word acronym without it, but given Facebook being Meta now, perhaps there is a four-letter acronym that could be used instead. I leave the anagraming of that as an exercise for the reader) company takes you through building out some system with eleventy-billion users and how cool they all are to have eleventy-billion users.\nHe'll let you know that you need to handle a gazillion api calls an hour, and a gajillion bytes of data per call so that they can check that you know what Amazon Web Service you need to handle that kind of volume since you're definitely not building it yourself.\nAccording to Claude, here are the top ten apps by Monthly Active Users (MAUs):\n\n\nFacebook - 3.07 billion MAU Most Popular Social Media Apps in 2025 | Piktochart\n\n\nYouTube - 2.54 billion MAU Most Popular Social Media Platforms &amp; Apps (2025)\n\n\nWhatsApp - 2 billion MAU (some sources report up to 3 billion)\n\n\nInstagram - 2 billion MAU Most Popular Social Media Apps in 2025 | Piktochart\n\n\nWeChat - 1.38 billion MAU (primarily China)\n\n\nTikTok - 1.59 billion MAU Most Popular Social Media Apps in 2025 | Piktochart\n\n\nFacebook Messenger - 947 million MAU\n\n\nTelegram - ~800 million MAU (estimated)\n\n\nSnapchat - ~750 million MAU (estimated)\n\n\nX (formerly Twitter) - 556 million MAU\n\n\nNow I trust these numbers as much as a Bernie named Madhoff, but let's just take them and do some math.\nFirst, there's a steep drop off from one to ten, and if we assume that whatever we're building is not going to hit billion user scale immediately, maybe we can take half a billion as a starting point.\nNow 500 million feels like a big number, but if we divide it by the thirty days in a month we get 16 million DAUs.\nDAUs are of course higher than that, so, in order to make the math easier, let's say its 24 million.\nThat's a million users per hour if we assume a smooth average, and that's 277 users per second.\nIf all of those users are making like four to five api calls that's about a thousand per second.\n\nThe latest in the Raspberry Pi line.\nThis guy above is a Raspberry Pi 5.\nIt costs a hundred dollars, and can handle a thousand api call per second no sweat.\nI don't know, let's say I'm off by a factor of ten and twitter does ten thousand api calls per second.\nDo you think nazi musk can afford ten of these bad boys?\nThe question then is what do these companies need with the gigantic datacenters they're actually using.\nAs anyone whose had an empty drawer in their house knows, nature abhors a vaccuum.\nIf you're paying for computers and storage, you better be using and filling them.\nAnd that's what they're doing, filling them with every single last piece of data on you that they can.\nThey're not doing four or five api calls per user, they're making forty or fifty, tracking every last millisecond you spend on posts and videos.\nDid you go down, and then up?\nDid you tap for more info, check the poster's profile, like, love, downvote, favorite, swipe, breathe heavily, tremble at all, you name it they're grabbing it.\nAnd why not?\nThey don't even need to pay people to analyze the data anymore.\nThey just feed it to more machines to determine what combination of colors and words and graphics will get you purchasing more.\nThey have to do this to pay themselves and their investors, and now that they're buying islands and rocket ships, the checks they expect look like those numbers above: billions and billions.\nSagan wrote a book with that title, which starts by explaining he would never use that term because it's too imprecise.\nAnd he was a cosmologist thinking about the universe.\nIf there aren't even billions and billions of things in space, what the heck are they doing in a handful of people's bank accounts?\nWhen things get like that, you're supposed to be able to create competition to the giant firms, but how can you possibly compete with a platform serving half of the population of the Earth?\nWell first we have to answer what's competition?\nThe pin factory\nIn The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, his first example is a pin factory.\nIt was a good in high demand back in the eighteenth century.\nOne with clear inputs, and outputs, and not a whole lot of reason for global distribution.\nThere weren't technological improvements other than in the manufacturing process, and the labor wasn't particularly skilled.\nOne interesting thing about the economics of the eighteenth century: you couldn't move pins around the globe at close to the speed of light.\nThe rules of microeconomics where firms are bounded by location, and materials, are no more in a world where bits and bytes flow through tubes unfettered.\nHow on Earth, pun intended, do you start a business to compete with a business that can deliver its \"goods\" instantaneously to everyone?\nIn the biz we talk about \"products.\"\nThe product is the thing that you sell, as in the thing your customers give you money for.\nDo you give Meta money to use Instagram?\nWho does?\nObviously its advertisers, and behind advertisers are businesses.\nThey buy ads, but what is it they're buying?\nIs it reach?\nIs it the demographics?\nWell let's talk about both of those.\nReach is the whole kit and caboodle for the internet.\nThe promise that everyone in the whole world can buy what you're selling just by you buying a domain name and setting up a small site is just as awesome today as it was thirty years ago.\nAs the gigantocorp platforms grew and grew, it became harder and harder (or more expensive) to break through the noise.\nAfter a while, the only way for your marketing dollars to hit the ROI (return on investment) they were looking for was to \"go viral.\"\nGuess what happens when you go viral.\nYour website tips over, and you run out of inventory, and a bunch of people get pissed, and it's like the lottery winner who's broke two years later because they can't figure out how to stay rich.\nWhat about demographics?\nFacebook boasts four billion MAUs, and Instagram half of that.\nIf you're marketing something though I think you already know which app you're marketing on.\nBefore the internet, people would self-select into spaces and media to consume, and there wasn't much of a need for further segmenting within groups.\nThere's not a huge overlap between the people walking into Hot Topic, and the ones walking into Abercrombie and Fitch, and there's no real need for those brands to intrude on blog posts becase the people who like them, will find them.\nThe premise of digital advertising is that we know everything about everyone, and thus can put exactly what they want to see right in front of them.\nIt is a ridiculous premise, which is why it's so lucrative.\nBecause it's the modern equivalent of a rainmaker.\nDid your campaign fail to make it rain because the advertisers suck, or because you didn't spend enough?\nIf there's no competition, there's only one variable in your campaign to change you know?\nSo here's our premise.\nThe selling points of digital advertising are reach, their ability to attract large numbers of humans to their platforms, and demographics, their knowledge of who you are and what you're looking to buy right now.\nAnd that, currently, they suck, but no one's figured out how to do these two points better.\nReach\n\n\"We met at Starbucks. Not the same Starbucks, it was actually the Starbucks across the street...\"\nIt's fun to make fun of the Starbucks across the street from each other, but there's actually a pretty good reason for it.\nMost stores come equipped with two point-of-sale (POS) systems, and there's a maximum to how many customers can go through those systems.\nSo if a store hits that max, you open another store across the street.\nThis is how scaling works with computers too, and a lot of time, money, and energy is put into making sure that the machines that a platform runs on all work the same, and give people the same experience.\nYou don't see the instagram across the street, but that's what's happening.\nThere's no reason why you couldn't see it though.\nFor those of you who have never played a Massively Multiplayer Online game, here's what you see when you first sign up:\n\nAs you can see, there are quite a few Starbucks on this street (this is the World of Warcraft server selection screen).\nOn the engineering side of things, instagram and WoW are more or less the same.\nTons of users, tons of computation needed to serve the users, and a need for this system to never fail.\nThe difference is that WoW users expect a little more control their experience.\nNow, what's interesting in the MMO is that users are persistent characters, so even though the realm they choose has the same software, the state of the realm is unique to the realm.\nYou can see a number of PvP realms where players can fight each other.\nEach one of those has some sort of mini-culture around its PvP, which can define and change the game pretty significantly.\nSort of like how the baristas at the Starbucks across the street might affect which one you go to (no, she's not interested in you, she's just being nice).\nInstagram doesn't want its users to create anything like that because it undermines their ability to control what is displayed to its users.\nControl over what is displayed to its users is how Instagram sells advertising, which is how they make money.\nSo, what is Instagram's product?\nIt looks like this:\n\nAt least the good people in Kubrick's world were kind enough to make the science tapping into your brain visible.\nMaybe there's room to play with this realm idea though.\nGive the users a little more control over what content they consume, and maybe even make it so people can setup their own realms like some games like Minecraft do.\nNot sure how to monetize it though, but we can punt on that for now.\nDemographics\nI live in Portland, Oregon, and in the early tens and teens of this second millenium, there was a great show called Portlandia.\nIn the first or second episode, a proprietor of a feminist book store tells Steve Buscemi that he should head to a puzzle store to find what he's looking for.\nThe shocked Buscemi asks, \"where is there a puzzle store?\"\nThe proprietor responds by listing off all the locations where there are puzzle stores.\nIt cracks me up every time.\nAre there puzzle stores where you live?\nI'm guessing probably not.\nThey're kind of peculiar to the kind of place where grown ups take pride in being big wholesome kids and grandparents at the same time and/or smoke enough weed to require a steady stream of jigsawed cardboard to stay busy.\nNow if you're a puzzler in need of a fix, and you've just moved to Portland you might google up the nearest puzzle store, and then head to it.\nWe'll get to search in a second.\nChances are though, you found out about puzzle stores the same way as Buscemi on Portlandia: word of mouth.\nMarketers will tell you that nothing beats word of mouth, but I don't think we need to ask them why.\nWho're you going to trust to best understand your puzzling needs?\nA system of cold, and uncaring machines programmed by cold and uncaring people, or your friends?\nYour friends know you better than the machine, and more importantly know the context through which you're asking.\nThe answer to, \"I need a puzzle stat!\" and \"I need a puzzle for my nephew's birthday.\" might be different.\nThe machine doesn't understand your context when you search for, \"puzzle stores near me,\" but your friends do.\nWell that's not entirely true.\nThere's actually quite a bit that the machines are doing to try and understand that context.\nIs your nephew's birthday in google calendar?\nWell then the machines know you might be looking for puzzles for his gift.\nDid you get a receipt sent to your gmail after your last puzzle purchase?\nWell then the machines know about your puzzle addiction.\nDoes writing a truly massive amount of software in order to spy on all digital communiques to attempt to extract what our friends do for us for free seem like an incredible waste of time and resources?\nPerhaps not, perhaps it's so successful that we humans have embraced our Orwellian present so as to more efficiently purchase socks.\nLet us check the average click-through rate of the ads served by Google and Meta, companies whose combined market cap would put them seventh, between the UK and France, in national GDP.\nThere's a lot of blah blah blah, and it's impossible to get a real number because these two companies are basically giant deception machines, but it's somewhere between 1 and 2 percent.\nLet's call it 1.5%.\nHow often do you click on the stuff your friends send you?\nNow we're going to start talking about my stack here, and while I've gotten tons of help, it's still sort of mine to shepherd for now, and so I'd like to make something quite clear.\nI think you, like all people, are cool and interesting, but if I'm going to get to know you it's going to be over coffee or beers some time, and not through the systematic harvesting and exploitative usage of your personal data.\nI have neither the interest nor the time to do so, and I don't really trust myself to protect your personal data from the 1337 h4x0rz of the world.\nSo instead of collecting all of this stuff and using it to ruin the internet, the idea is to let your friends do that work like they already do, and just give them a piece of the action.\nA tale of two cities\nPortland is known for a good many things, but let's focus on two right now: our general love of the outdoors--specifically those of us who like to climb things--and our sizable lesbian population.\nThere are a number of products in the world that cater to these two groups, subaru outbacks being one of the most noticeable, but for our discussion here I'd like to talk about just one.\nThe humble carabiner.\n\nWhether it's helping you survive a fall to gravity, or a fall to love, this little guy's gonna have an outsized impact for the cost.\nFor a variety of reasons, the carabiner is of rather significant importance to the two groups above.\nIf you're not part of those groups already though, do you have any idea what the difference is between all of those carabiners?\nI don't, and it's not entirely clear where I might go to learn.\nFor some things it's fine to rely on trial and error, but are you ready to trust your life, romantically or otherwise, to fate?\nNow let's say I'm a fashion-conscious rock-climbing lesbian with a degree in mechanical engineering, and a passion for metalurgy.\nI start a blog called Tie the Metal Knot about finding love and carabiners in the Portland bouldering scene.\nI should of course be compensated for my expertise, and to do so I load up my poor blog with ad cancer, of which I see a fraction of a penny for every person who lands on the page.\nI also go through the hassle of becoming an affiliate at Amazon so I can get a dime from carabiners sold through my site should someone wade through the swamp of ads and actually find them, at least until that link dies because Amazon killed my preferred carabiner store's business, and now it's just a dead link amongst all the other garbage that covers up my thoughtful and interesting prose.\nI probably don't even need to show you a screenshot of a site set up like this, but I'm going to anyways:\n\nWas gonna show you the ads, but can't even do that with this barely dismissable popup asking for your personal information.\nThe hypothesis is that all of our sites are like this because there isn't a better alternative.\nIf we can find a way to monetize sites as much or more through another mechanism then people will adopt that.\nBut, if you make it an either/or then you need to grow big enough to compete with everyone with a gmail and/or facebook account.\nThat's pretty much everyone on Earth with a computer.\nSo instead of making it either/or we worked out a way to make it whichever works better.\nIf you want ad-infested garbage in front of you all the time, you can keep on doing what you've always done.\nIf you want a cleaner interface that can make more people and not gigantocorps money, then read on.\nAll about that base\n\nThis ^^^ is a website.\nYour device and its browser are called the client.\nThe computer that these words come from is called a server.\nWhen you type realultimatepower.net into your browser's url bar, a number of computers talk to each other to figure out where that server is and get you the words that are that website (feel free to check it out, it's pretty sweet).\nThe problem is that computers, as powerful as they are, are still finite so if your website is super popular and/or does a lot of things, you need a bunch of servers.\nThat can get expensive, and people aren't big on paying for things on the internet.\nNow there's no real reason why the words that are a website can't come from different servers.\nIn fact that's how it works right now.\nThere are plenty of servers serving up google for example.\nBut what you don't see all that much is servers serving the same words from different domain names.\nThat's the thing those game servers are doing.\nAnd it's the thing the Fediverse does with Mastodon, Pixelfed, and Lemmy.[^1]\nThat's great, but they're all still doing something that's not the best for users, namely keeping everything you do around forever and ever.\nThere's value to the platform in the permanence of the things people have and create on them, because that's what these platforms are.\nWhether servers in the Fediverse, or Bluesky are selling this data or not is debatable.\nThat they're being scraped, for free, by tons and tons of other platforms for data is not.\nAs the platforms grow, they become more expensive to run, and even Mark Cuban's Bluesky money is finite, especially if he runs for president, so how do you foresee them monetizing should they live long enough to become the villain?\nI on the other hand, and again I want this to be crystal clear, do not care what you had for brunch back in 2012.\nI don't think that should have much bearing on either of our lives.\nStill, someone's gotta pay to run the servers.\nEither I build a platform that steals your data and sells it to advertisers to sell it to businesses for businesses to sell you stuff, or you buy stuff and that pays for the servers somehow.\nY'all probably buy stuff online already, we just need a way to make sure the server gets paid when you do.\nNow in the real world when the puzzle store gets too busy, someone opens a puzzle store across the street.\nPeople sort of self-select which puzzle store they pick, mostly because crossing the street is onerous.\nIn the digital world, people usually don't have visibility to which side of the street their server's on.\nAnd when they do, like with the game servers, they usually have to pick one and stick with it so you don't lose all your stuff.\nBut if you don't have stuff to lose, what's to stop you from just picking whatever server's closest, or fastest, or pays you the most, or is run by your buddy?\nThis kind of server is what I'm calling a base.\nAnd it belongs to us.\nBase and essence\nIn philosophy there's a distinction between what a thing is (essence), and what it does (function).\nIn software, pretty much everyone cares about essence because at a pretty fundamental level the function of computers is all the same: bytes moving around and doing things.\nA base has no inherent essence, it only has function.\nAnd that function is to monetize content creation through user transactions to businesses directly without the need for advertisement-based discovery.\nAllow me to show you the pictures of what I mean.\nHere is the current monetization flow of the internet:\n\nIn this picture users and content creators are linked to businesses via advertisers and content platforms.\nAgain, most of us buy stuff online, it's not that we want all businesses to go away, but having the advertisers and content platforms as the link between us makes businesses, and consumers beholden to them for our needs.\nBeholden is just another word for exploitable.\nAnd in economics, whenever you can exploit a resource, you're going to be making money.\nRemember, we're talking about what a base does, not what it is.\nHere's the picture:\n\nPlease note the use of the color green to indicate money flowing into your pockets.\nThis is what a base does it lets you join along with other members of whatever group/community/horde might care about the base to figure out ways of buying things on the internet that pays the group/community/horde and not already rich dudes buying up land in Hawaii.\nHow it does this is up to the group/community/horde that uses it.\nYou wanna create a gaming store community where everyone gets a piece of the action when some hot new cardboard drops?\nGo for it.\nYou wanna create a safe space for new parents to exchange hand-me-downs, and share in the profit when someone just has to have a brand new stroller?\nYou can do that.\nBases are easy to join, and easy to leave.\nDon't want to hear about the latest SCOTUS news for one freaking minute?\nJust leave that base.\nNeed to get your fix after you cool down?\nRejoin the base.\nDifferent platforms can drift off the same bases, and you can have multiple versions of the same platform connected to different bases.\nDon't want to think about all of this?\nJust join a base where someone else thinks about it for you.\nI don't have all the answers, so I'm not going to build a system that tries to tell you what to do.\nI just want to build a system that takes money from gigantocorps and gives it to you.\nThis is what I came up with.\nConclusion\nYou know how everything's getting more expensive?\nHow those great spaces for kids, and cafes that won't kick you out for just having a coffee keep closing?\nHow you really want to buy from anywhere but Amazon, but man is it just too convenient to be able to order from your couch, and have some overworked and underpaid blue-vest-wearing sap run up your walk so they can stay on their delivery schedule?\nA base is just a computer, and computers can be small.\nLook up.\nCould you stick a shelf up above eye level with a machine or two on it processing transactions, and making you, or your favorite cafe, or a non-profit you contribute to money?\nPeople are already doing this with home servers, but they're renting them out to folks so they can scrape data around the internet for advertising.\nBe the change you want to see.\nStart a base with your friends, make money, tell google, amazon, and meta to kick rocks.\nIf it doesn't work, you turn the computer off and hand it to your niece or nephew to play roblox on or something.\nIf you make a dollar though, and I don't know anything about you, it will make me so happy.\nSo don't tell me about it.\nTell your friends.\n\nSo the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the\nLawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the\narrow or spear, starting here and going straight there and THOK!\nhitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central concern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the\nstory isn't any good if he isn't in it.\n\nI don't want to be a hero, and there is no narrative arc here.\nI just think it's high time the regular folk had a carrier bag (or boat!) of there own.\nOne they can load up with bananas, and socks, and mall ninja shit, and empty at home without having to sign their life away to companies the size of governments.\nThat's why I go by planetnineisaspaceship.\nI'm easy enough to find if you'd like, it's not a very effective pseudonym.\nIt's a reminder that the spaceship, the boat, the carrier bag is the purpose.\nIf you've setup a server before, or even if you haven't you can check out the allyabase repo here.\nIf you haven't setup a server before, I'd recommend watching a video or two on how to setup a minecraft server as those usually have what you need in them.\nThis system is in production, but also a definite work in progress.\nIf you run into any issues find me on discord or email me at zach at planetnine dot app.\n[1]: If you've never heard of the Fediverse, it can be overwhelming to dive into it. So I recommend not doing that unless you're in for some deep cut tech.\n","id":"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/back-to-base-ics/","title":"\"Back to base-ics\""},"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/constraints/":{"body":"Author: cyypherus\nConstraints\nOver the last year or so I've been on-and-off building a rust UI layout crate called backer. The project started with a very naive approach, as things usually do, where the layout tree is traversed, each node splitting the available area into segments or reducing the area available to children for padding.\nPerfect! It couldn't be more simple, why do frameworks complicate this so much! Let's try our first layout.\nI want to put my content in a row, with a fixed size-button in the first segment.\n\n\nThis is fine, now what happens when the available area decreases?\n\nWell, the entire naive approach falls apart, everything is bad, &amp; I am bad at software.\nOnward!\nSo how should we handle the case where the parent is \"offered\" less space than it's child needs? There needs to be some interaction between a container and it's contents to ensure that we respect things like fixed size, minimum size, or maximum size.\nAnyone who builds UI is more than familiar with the beloved concept of constraints, &amp; I needed to beef up my approach quite a bit. How should a constraint system be written &amp; more importantly, how should it behave?\nFirst things first, containers must check with their contents to see if there are any constraints they should follow to avoid ugly overlap like we saw earlier. The ideal result should look something like this.\n\nThe yellow segment has nothing in it, so it has no reason not to compress to make room for the element with the fixed size. It should be gladly willing to compress to a width of 0.\nAlong with this requirement, we want to respect minimum / maximum constraints as well. Say we are laying out a row of elements that all have constraints on their widths. Our list of constraints looks like this:\n\nWe have 400 units of space to divvy up, what's next?\nHow do we fairly allocate space to each of the elements without breaking their constraints &amp; ensuring we use exactly 400 units of space?\nDread\nIf you take a moment to consider it, this is actually quite tricky. The simplest approach I can imagine is to start with a guess, say, even allocation, and then nudge by tiny increments until the constraints are satisfied. Unfortunately, this can't possibly scale well, and nudging floats is terribly ugly. Surely the internet has some quick answers!\nWell, seems like all we need is a constraint solver.\n&amp; it looks like the common solution in modern software is something called the Cassowary algorithm?\n&amp; oh, god, cassowary is not simple at all. It's heavy on some linear arithmetic &amp; it has some strange features that I don't necessarily even want - like the ability for constraints to be broken based on their level of priority?\nThis doesn't seem to be a problem that is solved frequently, or at least not in a form I'm able to find.\nAnyhow, it's been effective in the past for me to let hard problems steep a while (in my head), &amp; what else is there to do when you can't solve something?\nAha! The Algorithm Appears\nThe solution arrives! (I think I was in the shower when it popped into my head, lol)\nBack to our example, 400 units to divvy, &amp; 4 elements with width constraints.\nLet's start with even distribution.\nFirst we will check if any elements constraints are not satisfied with our initial state.\n\nWe then shift the allocated amounts to the nearest amount that satisfies the constraints of each element.\nThe initial offering, 100, is the red line. The colored rectangles are the valid ranges that we need to satisfy, &amp; the amount we're shifting from the initial allocation is shown by the pale red / pink lines.\n\n\nWhen we take space from an element we end up with extra space that needs to be filled - a surplus.\nLikewise, when we give space to an element we are using space we may or may not have - a defecit.\n\nWe're now left with satisfied constraints, but some extra space in the pool that needs to be filled.\nWe need to redistribute the surplus without breaking any constraints, &amp; the only way to guarantee we aren't breaking constraints is to sort the elements by the amount of space they're allowed to consume.\nBoth element one and element three are at their limit, but element two and four can both consume more space if needed.\n\nWe can now distribute excess starting with even distribution, or the smallest amount an element can consume - whichever is smaller.\nIn our case, we're lucky enough that the pool can be distributed evenly among the candidates but in other cases we have to make the distribution in increments (using the sort I mentioned) to ensure we don't step over any constraint boundaries.\n\n\nAnd finally, we've got a way to smoothly resolve constraints. The algorithm I've described is the algorithm backer boasts today &amp; the only reason ultra-smooth layout constraint resolution like this is possible with crates like the wonderful egui.\n\nThanks for reading &amp; happy coding :)\n\n\n","id":"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/constraints/","title":"Constraints"},"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/its-a-free-country/":{"body":"from the desk of planetnineisaspaceship\n\"It's a free country\"\nBack in 2015 I bought a house in southeast Portland with a friend.\nWe had the benefit of both having gone to a small college in town called Reed.\nReed is well known for its academics, and somewhat lax approach to substance use (at least it was back in our day).\nThose of us who went there are governed by the Honor Principle, an ill-defined set of rules that mostly amount to \"don't be an asshole.\"\nTrue to our youthful indoctrination, we drew up an agreement with provisions on what should happen if either of us got a real girlfriend, but which was a bit light on what will happen financially upon sale of our joint asset.\nSo when it came time to sell The Dojo, an affectionate nickname earned by the Asian decor that pre-dated our purchase, I consulted my lawyer, another Reedie, on what the legal and financial ramifications of the sale would be.\nOur conversation went something like this.\nMe: So what I blah blah blah like if I could just write a check blah blah.\nLawyer: Oh yeah, you can do that.\nMe (flabbergasted): What do you mean?\nI can just write a check like that to him?\nMy lawyer smiled that smile that only lawyers smile when they've just lawyered the shit out of something, and spread his arms wide.\nLawyer: Of course!\nIt's a free country.\nThat friend and I still cheers to the day I wrote him a six figure check, deposited it, and then went across the street to The Lutz, our alma mater's goto watering hole to celebrate.\n\n\"Can't you just like, not do that?\"\nIn my twenties I worked for two well-regarded gigantocorps, one involving coffee and the other named after a fruit.\nBoth of them, while touting how great they were for employees, were aggressively anti-union.\nSitting in a room making $24/hr and listening to some lawyer making $300/hr tell you how the folks making $13/hr should shut up and like it so that the folks making $0/hr because they're already millionaires can make more money wouldn't be the worst place to start the revolution.\nI, of course, was already well on my way to starting The Revolution, and so my take away from that meeting was, why on Earth does every stupid company do this?\nLike, can't you just not do that?\nWell it kind of turns out that you can't.\nSort of.\nIt wasn't until much later in my career that I learned that corporate titles have actual meaning beyond conferring muckity muck status to mostly incompetent white men.\nFor example, Directors and above in publicly traded companies have a fiduciary responsibility to the company, and thus the shareholders of that company.\nFiduciary means acting in the financial best interest of the company.\nAny fledgling day trader will tell you that making moves that are in the financial best interest of anything is more art (luck) than skill, but there is something pretty universally understood as bad for a company's bottom line: paying its workers more.\nThis means that by law, Directors and above at publicly traded companies must be anti-union.\nOf course union busting is illegal too so the real advantage lies with the group that can employ the most lawyers to figure out what can and cannot be done.\nAnd if you're wondering if it would just be cheaper to pay people more than employ all the lawyers needed to fight this ongoing battle just remember that if there's any group better at getting paid than unions, it's lawyers.\nAt the same time that this was going on at the fruit stand, as we called that fruit-named company, its stock price was rocketing up in value.\nI invested the ten percent max into the employee stock purchase plan, and after two years of that I had enough to go back to school.\nThat whole experience got me thinking about shareholders and employees, and really what is the value to society of people with enough wealth to invest in the stock market being the only ones to benefit from it?\nWell what if the shareholders of a company weren't rich people, but rather, like, not rich people?\nI thought I had come up with something novel, but it turns out the idea's been around for a while.\nThey're called cooperatives, and the oldest one still around in the US was started by a guy named Ben Franklin.\nCan't we all just get along?\nChances are, if you're in the US, your introduction to cooperatives has been through tiny grocery stores with a bit of something for every restrictive diet in existence.\nThese are great, but there's actually a much more common cooperative, and those are credit unions.\nNot only are credit unions more common in the US than other coops, but they're actually pretty common around the world.\nThat makes sense since it's actually pretty hard to make money as a bank unless you're serving people who have a bunch of money, and a bunch of money is not something all that many people on Earth have.\nOne of the interesting things about US corporate law is that corporations are very easy to own a piece of.\nUnlike moving money around, shares in a company can be owned and traded without a whole lot of problems.\nThis cavalier attitude towards the shared ownership of a corporate structures extends to cooperatives.\nDid you know you can just not do that?\nIf you've never worked for an early stage company, I'd imagine you probably aren't too familiar with how a cap table works.\n\nIn the early days of a company, before it starts making money, people work for under market value and a piece of the pie.\nThe conceit is that, should the company be successful, the piece plus salary should exceed what you would've made had you worked a regular job.\nCompeting for these pieces then are all these employees, the investors, and the founders of the company, each of whom have an incentive for their pieces to stay as big as possible.\nNo startup I've ever worked for has shown me the cap table, but I'll vouch for the fact that when it works, it's not the worst way to make a buck.\nThat is until you realize that you made a whole bunch of other people ten bucks.\nThen you have to wrestle with whether they deserved it, or were just being greedy dickheads.\nI bring this up to talk about the bajillionairs of our era.\nBezos, for example, owned nearly 50% of Amazon when it IPOed back in 1997.\nThis ownership is where the majority of his wealth comes from.\nThe promise of capitalism is that.\nNot that you'll get paid a lot, but rather that you make something so valuable that you become a gajillionaire because of it.\nI'm sure we all have our opinions on the morality of this, but you can hardly argue with the efficacy.\nThere's a seemingly endless supply of greedy dickheads trying to become billionaires too.\nBut did you know, and this was kind of surprising to me when I first started looking into it, that you don't have to be a greedy dickhead?\nThere is no fiduciary responsibility to yourself.\nYou do not need to hold on to your equity like Smaug buried deep in the Lonely Mountain hoarding his horde.\nWhat would happen if someone made Amazon, but gave that near 50% out to the employees and then users of Amazon?\nI don't really know, but it kind of feels like it's worth finding out.\nDo we need them, or do they need us?\nI had the wonderful good fortune of getting into punk rock as a teenager in the Chicagoland area in the late 90s.\nThus my class consciousness was awakened through reading the liner notes of bands like Dillinger Four, and The Broadways.\nAmongst all of the veritable jams from that time, [We'll Have a Party][party] by The Broadways (Brendan Kelly and Chris McCaughan of The Lawrence Arms' Yardbirds) became my life's ballad over time.\nThe song's a love story put on hold as the system is torn down.\nEvery line is gold, provoking thought and consideration of just how ludicrous and desperate the system can be.\nGo listen.\nI'll wait.\nHere's the stanza for this post:\n\nThe bosses learned to fool the slaves into 8 hour days\nBut do we need them or do they need us?\nSeems like we dwell on these useless things, lifestyles of wealth, pursuit of money\nCompetition says to beat each other down for personal gain\n\nDoes the fruit stand sell iPods if we all quit?\nOf course.\nDoes my first startup sell transit tickets without even one member of the people who took a pay cut to keep the company going?\nMaybe...\nIs the equity payout for the founders justified at 10 times that of early employees?\nWhat about 100 times that?\nKeynes in the riveting (/s) General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, points out that the Classical Economic notion that Labor negotiates for real wages based on its productivity is undermined by the fact that Labor has to negotiate for actual real world wages that, you know, let you buy food and stuff.\nThe more well-known Marx had already pointed out that Labor was getting stiffed out of the fruits of its labor since profit was going to the bosses instead of to themselves.\nSo in a capitalist society, the pressure from the bosses is to get you coming and going.\nLabor is underpaid, and then the profit garnered from that injustice is spread amongst the already wealthy.\nAnd for a few centuries now, the goal we've been sold on is joining their club, and not marching them to the guillotines.\n\nBack to my first startup, and someone leaving.\nDoes Bezos' life change all that much if his 50% becomes 48% because he had to spend a bit more to retain someone, or replace someone?\nHow much does your life change if tomorrow you stopped getting paid?\nThat's the inequality in entrepreneurialship.\nBezos has to roll the dice on having a few less billions than all his billions.\nYou have to roll the dice on whether you get to afford food next week.\nSeems like we need them more than they need us.\nAnd before anyone tries to say, oh but Bezos was risking it all, let's remember how his parents gave him six figures early in the company's history.\nSix figures is probably what I've given my therapist over the years because of my parents.\nRobin Hood is an app for Wall Street Bros\nThe whole lose your job, and immediately become destitute is the reason why some countries have strong social safety nets.\nWe here in the US do not.\nWhether we should or not is certainly something people will debate, but I won't debate it here.\nInstead I'll just say, whereever you stand on the issue, we're unlikely to all be able to quit our jobs with government help in the next few years.\n\nOl' Johnny's gonna have to save up for a year or two before singing this one these days\nSo, in order to combat the gap between Bezos' 50%, and you not being able to buy groceries if he fires you, it's worth trying to figure something else out.\nFor pretty much anyone whose ever had to supplement their income, we already know what that something is: you get a second job.\nYou know what sucks?\nGetting a second job.\nLet's see if we can make it a little better.\nI think this article from 80k hours gives a nice overview of what to look for in a job.\n\nWork that's engaging\nWork that helps others\nWork you're good at\nWork with supportive colleagues\nWork that doesn't have major negatives\nWork that fits with the rest of your life\n\nWell I don't know about you, but that sounds like doing whatever it is you do with your friends to me.\nI wonder if there's something we could be doing to get paid there.\nEvery summer Games Done Quick puts on a week long marathon of video game speed runs.\nThere is a t-shirt company called The Yetee specializing in video game and fantasy-themed apparel.\nThroughout the marathon they make sizable donations to support the runners, and the group they're raising money for which is typically Doctors Without Borders.\nThose donations are marketing of course, but I'd rather $10k go to Doctors Without Borders than Zuckerberg's island ruination fund.\nNow we have a nice little loop: The Yetee donates to market -&gt; speed runners volunteer their time to give this platform -&gt; people buy from The Yetee -&gt; repeat.\nThe platform is what makes the big donation worthwhile at a marketing tool.\nBut what if we didn't need the platform?\nThe whole ecosystem of this speed running marathon is repeated all over the Earth in the hobbies and passions that we share with our friends.\nThey are what's engaging, and what we're good at, and by golly when you tell someone to purchase some super esoteric piece of essential paraphenelia, you should get a buck or two if they buy it.\n\nThis bad boy retails for twelve hundred dollars. If you know why, and can articulate that to someone who buys it, I feel like you should get a cut.\nMr. Wonderful\nIf you've never seen Shark Tank, it's a show where entrepreneurs get to go in front of a panel of five investors, and pitch them their idea.\nFor someone who loves watching ideas get pitched, it's great even if the egregious percentages requested by the investors earns the show its name.\nThe central investor of the show is Kevin O'Leary, aka Mr. Wonderful, who is well known for pitching fledgling entrepreneurs on royalty deals.\nIn the early seasons these deals were pretty rightly mocked by the other sharks, but as they, and the entrepreneurs, realized what Shark Tank really is (a giant marketing vehicle), and thus who they are as the \"sharks\" (influencers), the deals made more sense.\nWhat's the difference between paying Mr. Wonderful and Google a quarter for every sale?\nA 2023 report from Morning Consult found that 57% of gen Z wants to be influencers.\nWe have all sorts of words for the artifacts of this stuff, short-form content, reels, tiktoks, blah blah blah.\nIt's all media.\nWhen I was gen Z's age, everyone wanted to be in a band, and it wasn't just for the love of song.\nLook back at that list of what people want to do for a job:\n\nWork that's engaging\nWork that helps others\nWork you're good at\nWork with supportive colleagues\nWork that doesn't have major negatives\nWork that fits with the rest of your life\n\nOne of the best things we did when I was in my band (we were not serious. We were drunk.) was make shower curtains for merch.\nThey were hysterical, and we sold out of them in minutes.\nAnd we donated all the proceeds to a worthy cause: buying beer at our next practice.\nThis wasn't before the internet, but it was before the SoMa apps ruined it.\nCould we have sold more shower curtains than we did?\nMaybe, but that would've required paying for advertising because how else would anyone find out about them?\nHere's the hypothetical today: the band and I hop online and drop a grand on ad spend, and that gets spread amongst content creators.\nWe find that our shower curtains make more money than the mediocre slop rock we play, and pivot to grow our fledgling shower curtain empire.\nNext thing you know, we're on Shark Tank talking about how our Customer Acquisition Cost is $3.37 and Mr. Wonderful's trying to sell us on a royalty so he can bestow upon us his brand.\nIt's sold as a win/win.\nHe makes money when we make money.\nYou watch the ep, and tell a friend about it, and that person goes off and buys one of our shower curtains...\nWhy don't you make money?\nWe all do that all the time with our friends and families.\nRecommendations, opinions, enthusiastic suggestions, this isn't an anti-capitalist screed, we all buy stuff all the time, and we rely on these things from others to point us in the right direction.\nSo why do none of us get paid for that?\n\"1984 man, you were right, that's a typo\"\nWell, the dastardly answer to that question is that you have been.\nThe advertising aparatuses that generate this buzz, and associates your legwork with their products is giving you free software to steal your personal information for your enjoyment.\nGoogle gives you free email, Meta free anxiety, Amazon close to free shipping, and all you have to give them is all of your browsing habits.\nThe thing is, what you do with your time, online or otherwise, is your \"brand,\" and just like Mr. Wonderful, you should be compensated for it.\nJust because your 32 followers are composed primarily of the birdwatching group you joined briefly five summers ago to have an excuse to get out of the house, doesn't mean you shouldn't get a dollar if someone buys the bird shirt you just saw somewhere.\nWhen you start putting this all together, you might ask, might it be possible to create a company that did tech-like things, and paid people royalties with every purchase?\nYou might then call up your lawyer, and layout this grand plan.\nAnd then you get to watch him spread his arms once again, and remind you, \"Of course! It's a free country.\"\nCool.\nNow what's interesting about paying people when they help sell something is you no longer have to spy on them to try to figure out what they want.\nSo we get to kill two gigantocorp bedrocks with one stone.\nBut what about the free software and stuff?\nWell, us programmers are weird.\nOur field is very highly paid, but quite a few of us are quite happy programming things we like for free.\nThe thing I like is ripping the system.\n\"So simple it just might work. Then we'll quit our jobs.\"\nSo here's the whole idea in a nutshell.\nPeople who sell things on the internet allow their things to be sold on this platform, which is non-exclusive, and requires minimal effort.\nYou all become independent contractors who get paid whenever a sale is made that you had a hand in.\nMe, and a group of open source developers, provide the software that makes all this work for free.\nI learned a new word the other day: reciprocity.\nWell to be fair I knew the word, but I learned it in a new context where it refers to a kind of sustainable economic loop where the outputs of one transaction are used as the inputs for a second, which then outputs back to the first.\nI'm relatively certain that the coiners of the term would bristle at its usage with tech platforms, but the class war necessitates some linguistic casualties.\nCurrently, the value you bring to these transactions is extracted from you and monetized by the gigantocorps.\nI want to pay you for that value.\n(We didn't really get into it, but these transactions run through infrastructure housed in cool spaces that you can help monetize too).\nIt's like a big biodome, but instead of a biome, its binary.\nA binaridome if you will.\nAll of this stuff is doable, it just takes one thing: people not being greedy dickheads.\nI'd like to invite y'all to not be greedy dickheads with me.\nIt'd be your second job (or third or fourth, I don't know your story), you can even put it on your LinkedIn/resume--influencer, content marketer, philosophizer--doesn't matter to me, I'll vouch for you.\nAnd all the money I make on this stuff, minus what I need to put my kid through college and retire at some point, I'll turn around and pay out to you as royalties for being yourself.\nBecause at the end of the day, the notion that someone should own 50% of a company that many people have worked hard to build only makes sense to entitled psychopaths.\nAnd now those dickheads want to be kings.\nSo we're gonna have to get a little state motto of Virginia, or be ready for prima nocta shenanigans.\nLFG\nI'm going to outline how this works in the next post.\nBut I want to introduce the new Planet Nine logo here.\nWhen you see this guy on something around cyberspace it means that someone is trying to be cool.\nAnd remember, all of this nonsense wasn't built in a day.\nIt's not going to be undone in a day either.\nBut trust me when I say, I'm going to do my damnedest to make it fun to try.\n","id":"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/its-a-free-country/","title":"\"It's a free country\""},"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/matrix-digital-rain/":{"body":"Author: wick3dr0se\nWriting a Matrix Digital Rain\n\nWriting a terminal based matrix digital rain is fairly simple; Even utilizing raw ANSI escape sequences, we can make one in under 20 lines of code with a shell scripting language like Bash. Similarly in most programming languages\nFor simplicity of the article, we won't implement starting position, random initial character highlighting or anything too fancy. This implementation utilizes the Select Graphic Rendition, specifically the 4-bit green color sequence for portability as well\nFor a full-featured implementation, check out the matrix digital rain I wrote in Bash (the inspiration for this post!)\nWhy Bash?\nBash is an excellent choice for this, because Bash comes pre-installed nearly everywhere. Most of the time it's the default shell interpreter. When writing pure Bash, it's super portable and easy to write. Generally Bash performs pretty well if usage of shell invoking procedures (such as command substituion) and external calls are limited\nConcept\nThis is just a general, base concept for a minimal matrix digital rain\nMy mind works well off concepts - In hopes it could help you, I'll leave this here to give some context on the implementation\n\nImplementation\nYou don't have to use raw ANSI escape sequences, you can use an abstraction like tput or a TUI library I wrote for writing scripts exactly like this one, among others of course. But for performance and portability's sake, it benefits to utilize ANSI escapes\nLet's start by initializing the terminal. How this works is up to you but I would utilize the terminal's alternative buffer and disable the cursor. Using the alternative buffer has the advantage of disabling scrolling and allowing us to reset the terminal to its initial state\nThese sequences are VT100 ANSI escape sequences, which are the standard, that terminal manipulation libraries abstract away\n\nThis is where it gets a little interesting! We have to do some basic equations. Here we utilize Bash's builtin $RANDOM variable to give us a random integer in the specified range. First we should calculate our symbols starting column, then our symbols printing delay and finally the amount of symbols to print down a column. We should loop over the terminal lines plus symbol length and calculate a random symbol\nNow it's time to put all our random calculations to work! Simply print the random symbol to the calculated column down the iterated row (line) and follow up behind the symbol length with an erase sequence. Wrapping up our rain function, sleep with the calculated delay to give the rain varying speed. Almost there! This is the bulk of it, and the entire complexity of the implementation\n\nAfter defining our functions, the script is super simple, only requiring a run forever loop and call to our rain function, sent to the background, with a short sleep delay to prevent our rain from absolute downpour and potential CPU havoc. Modifying the terminal state is completely optional but worth it\nDefining some symbols as a string\n\nThen we should probably trap some terminal cleanup so that we can reset our terminal state. Although one could just opt to close the terminal, skipping deinitializing and trapping interrupts entirely. Arguably the next step should be done first but in TUI scripts, it's common to define signal handlers before calling functions\n\nNext, we initialize the terminal by calling our init_term function\n\nTo finish it off, we execute the run forever loop, call our rain function in the background and sleep between calls for density\n\nThat's all!! Here is the entire implementation of our matrix digital rain in pure Bash using raw ANSI escape sequences, in under 20 lines of code!\n\nI hope the post was thorough and able to teach you something! If not, well sorry, I tried!

When Will Rogers was asked how the US should go about the issue of German U-boats, he simply recommended this: “Let the ocean be boiled.” A reporter asked how this could be done. In response to this, Will Rogers replies, “Man, I’m just the idea.” Source: theidioms.com\n\nPretty much everyone who works in tech has run into an idea like this.\nWhen your job is to actually deliver working things to customers, boil the ocean ideas range from laughable to morale-killers.\nBecause of this they're often met with doubt when brought to groups of industry folk, even if those folk are friendly and looking to help people learn (which if I'm being honest is not most groups of industry folk).\nDunning-Kruger\nDunning-Kruger is a cognitive bias where inexperienced people think things are simpler than they are, and experienced people also, but to a lesser degree, think things are simpler than they are.\nWhen you combine these with a boil the ocean idea, you can have people who don't know tech thinking, \"oh building this app would be so simple for an app developer,\" and experienced people thinking, \"this sounds easy, why don't you just do it yourself.\"\nMost of the time, Dunning-Kruger is a pain in the keister, because it takes the form of some CEO telling you which database to use, but there's this magical time before you realize how hard things are where you can do things that the curmudgeonly industry vets always talk themselves out of.\nThis is the land of Chris Sawyer, Tarn Adams, Notch, and ConcernedApe.1\nEven Tolkien spent two decades penning his Legendarium before he wrote the Lord of the Rings.\nHow to build big ideas\nIf you go into places where ideas get thrown around--startup forums, tech meetups--you'll often hear ideas are easy/cheap/inconsequential, and that things like execution are what matter.\nWhen it comes to making money, that's kind of true I guess, but this doc's not about making a startup.\nTruth is, maybe ideas are easy, but only a handful of people who have them make the ridiculous leap to actually thinking they should make their idea happen.\nI'm always reminded of what George Bernard Shaw said,\n\n“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”2\n\nAnd this is why it's important to understand what your motivations are in this big undertaking.\nIf you're out to make money\nAs I said this isn't a doc on how to make a startup, but I'll say a few words about why boiling the ocean is the wrong strategy if money is your goal.\nMoney, in software, is best made by startups (if you're not already an executive or something I guess), and for a startup to work you need two people: someone to build the thing, and someone to sell the thing.\nEveryone who has done one or the other thinks their thing is the most important, and they're both wrong, and it also doesn't matter since worrying about which is which is a quick way to make it so you never sell the thing in the first place.\nNot having skill in one thing or the other does not preclude you from taking on either role because they're both hard to get good at (see Dunning-Kruger above).\nAnd having your software product fail doesn't necessarily mean you make no money (read Money).\nBUT having your software product be some gigantic thing when you don't know how hard that is AND you actually need the money you're trying to make is a recipe for disaster.\nSo don't do that.\nIf not money than what?\nWell there are plenty of reasons to do things.\n\n\nFuture money (learning new skills, building a portfolio, etc)\n\n\nFor the sake/love of it\n\n\nTo impress people\n\n\nTo better humanity and/or the world\n\n\nBecause it is awesome\n\n\nIf these, or anything else fits your case, then get on the boat friend, and let's be unreasonable together.\nGet started before you start\nFor the following sections I'm going to assume you've chosen to build whatever it is you want.\nIf instead you want to sell it, I'm going to have to ask you to look elsewhere for guidance, lest I Dunning-Kruge myself on sales.\nOne of the first big projects I started was building a random music generator.\nNowadays I'm sure there's some AI-assisted music generators out there, but this was like 2001, and playing tones of any kind from a computer was pretty arcane.\nBig software projects are, usually, systems.\nThat is they are multiple software programs running in a cohesive unit to do whatever it is you're trying to do.\nIn a big company you would have a systems architect or two who put together system architecture.\nLet me show you some system architecture:\n\nI'm sure you can see why they make the big bucks.\nBreak your project down into parts like this.\nThe specifics of the parts aren't really important.\nWhat's important is your ability to articulate what the parts do and how they fit into your project.\nFor my random music generator I had a UI where you could pick things like keys and tempos, and I had the tone generator that built the tones via math based on the UI, and I had the song generator which put the tones in order based on musical rules.\nIn general the way to build your project is to just keep breaking down these boxes into smaller boxes until you hit a box that you feel you can do.\nThen you do that box.\nJust like eating an elephat--one bite at a time.\nI need help\nOk, here's the thing with big ideas, and really sharing things at all, when you share, you're sharing something you've thought about for months, or years, but the person you're talking to has just heard about what you're trying to tell them.\nSo big ideas tend to be just plain overwhelming to people when they first hear them.\nReally all ideas are kind of overwhelming when people first hear them--especially if they don't trust you to have good ideas yet.\nThis means if you're trying to recruit people, don't hit them with the whole idea of the back, instead focus on the first box you're trying to build.\nA lot of people make the mistake of trying to find people to commit to their project, but that's not really how things work in the (software) world.\nLife happens, and priorities shift around.\nIf I had a nickel for each time someone working with me on a project disappeared because they started seeing someone new, I'd have enough nickels to rehire some of them to work on the projects for real.\nYou can, and should, plan on committing all of the code and design yourself.\nIf you get help, great, if not the real help comes with the conversations you have with people who you bring along the way.\nNo end in sight\nSurvivorship bias is a hell of a drug.\nIt gives the illusion that success is a linear process, and one that simply starts at day one and grows.\nIt is not.\nWhen I was in high school, my friends and I used to call it the 99% pile.\n99% of all creative endeavors: music, art, code, etc, end up thrown away either not good enough or unfinished.\nNow that I'm older it's probably closer to 99.99%.\nThat doesn't mean we don't try.\nIf your dream takes five years to build, take five years to build it.\nIf it's no longer your dream after three years, find another dream.\nI've been working on mine for six and a half.\nGet on the boat\nWhen I was a kid, I remember hearing that we didn't know how people got to Hawaii.\nI was like, \"that's dumb. Of course we know. They got there by boat.\"\nIt's what we do as humans.\nYou put some barrier in front of us, and we'll figure out how to go over, under, or around it to find what's out there.\nWe're explorers.\nYou had an idea, built a boat, and now the island's telling you not to go.\nWho knows where the boat's gonna take you?\nIs it worth it to you to find out?\n1\nI choose solo game developers here because though some may have knwon programming, there's sooooo much more that goes into making games that I don't think it's a huge stretch to say they had a touch of the Dunning-Kruger at the onset of their endeavors.\n\n2\nOl' George penned Man and Superman in 1903, the same year Madame Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize for the first time. A writer friend of mine once admonished me for editing quotes to modern sensibilities of gender and race, but this quote, like the tech industry, and society in general is stupidly patriarchal, and I can't let it slide without comment.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/on-boiling-the-ocean/","title":"On boiling the

Illinois.\nCrisp and cool, the type of weather that my West Coast friends would call frigid today, but was just right for those of us in Chicago who wore hoodies year round.\nI was standing outside in a huddle of teenagers smoking in between bands at the house show going on in my friend's basement.\n\"Man, that last band really sucked.\"\nIt wasn't my most eloquent critique of an artistic endeavor, and one probably more borne out of a need to be an angry teen than comment on the aesthetics of the show.\nNext to me, a guy spun around.\n\"Where's your band man?\"\nHe was older, probably nineteen or twenty, an unfathomable four year gap to my sixteen year old sensibilities.\nI'm in my fourties now as I write this, and that his admonishment has stayed with me this long is a good indication he was on to something.\nSome history\nIn 1999, the cultural vanguard that is The Simpsons released Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner.\nIn the episode, Homer becomes a food critic who is first terrible at his job because he loves everywhere, and then is bad at his job because he needlessly criticizes everything.\nI'd be curious to know what Gen Z thinks of the episode as one of the casualties of our increasingly online world is the professional critic.\nPrior to the internet, getting your opinion in front of more people than your friends required a gatekept platform monetized through circulation and/or viewership numbers.\nThis meant that those who had opinions that would circulate were, for the most part, credentialed in whatever discipline it is they were critiquing.\nOne of the things that people who critique disciplines they're a part of have, in general, is some respect for the craft--one that is shown as a modicum of respect for at least those who are trying.\nIn 2004, former PayPal execs (man those assholes seem to be behind everything stupid on the internet), launched Yelp.\nYelp had the novel idea of letting any Tom, Dick, and Harry with a keyboard write a review for any business regardless of any credentials.\nThe crowd-sourcing of critique is a fascinating and dynamic transition from expertise to democratization.\nWhether it's been good, bad, or neutral is the topic of this post.\nMy band\nI would, like five years later, start a band.\nIt was not entirely not to spite that dude at that house show.\nIt did, just as I suspect that guy knew, open my eyes to what he was talking about, and I'm thankful for the perspective.\nSee, it is not the case that folks can't or shouldn't have opinions on the quality of any media they consume, of course they can.\nIt's that deciding to get in front of any group of people and present something you've created is hard, and you don't need some dickhead saying you suck right outside of the venue.\nSometimes showing appreciation for the craft is just keeping your mouth shut.\nIt also demonstrated to me that getting on that stage is sometimes the end in itself.\nOther people's opinions aren't really why you pick up the guitar.\nI mean, maybe that's it for some people, but it wasn't for me.\nDoing things for the sake of doing them is the subject of this other post.\nFollow the money\nIf you've ever read anything else that I've written then you know that my main axe to grind is with internet monetization, and the \"democratization\" of reviews is no exception.\nSo let's dive in.\nGene Siskel and Roger Ebert were the popular film critics of the rival newspapers the Chicago Tribune, and the Chicago Sun-Times respectively.\nTogether they hosted a weekly film critic show on PBS when I was a kid.\nIt was a brilliant move of coopetition as their show likely upped circulation numbers for both newspapers.\nNewspapers, and public broadcasting revenues are both driven by circulation/viewership.\nThe more people consuming the media, the more revenue.\nThis incentives a quality show, and quality columns from both Siskel and Ebert.\nThe two of them rose to cultural prominence for America's number two cultural export (music's number one).\nYelp, on the other hand, is a discovery tool just like a search engine.\nHere's what happens when I search for burrito on Yelp:\n\nAwesome.\nI was in the mood for some Taco Bell when I went searching for burritos in one of the best food cities in the country.\nI was gonna checkout what's after this row of sponsored things, and say at least that was good, but guess what.\nIt's more ads.\nOne for a burger place.\nAnother for Top Golf.\nSeriously fuck this shit.\nThe Demos\nThe summer of 1997, I watched every movie that came out in theaters.\nI lived across the street from a movie theater, I didn't own a car, and the girls didn't go to the pool every day so I had to fill my time with something.\nI don't remember all of the movies I watched, but I do remember I walked out of one, the only movie I've ever walked out of: Good Burger.\nHere is an excerpt of Roger Ebert's review of Good Burger:\n\n“Good Burger” was not made for me, and if I say I didn’t much enjoy it, that wouldn’t be useful information. The movie was made for daytime viewers of Nickelodeon, and it’s a spinoff from a character first seen in the cable channel’s “All That” comedy series–Ed, a fast-food worker whose life and dreams are dominated by his love for his work, and whose catchphrase, “Welcome to Good Burger,” is as well-known to kids as “Where’s the beef?” is at the other end of the age spectrum.\n\nExcellent.\nIf I had read that, I probably would have skipped the movie.\nIt wasn't that it was terrible, it was just for a much younger audience.\nOne that I might be able to appreciate now as a father, but that just didn't do it for me as a teenager.\nHere is the review I just pulled up from the crowdsourcing on rotten tomatoes:\n\nThis movie is fantastic. The character are fun, and like silly, Ed and his friendship with Dex was great, Ed was funny, and this movie is so funny, one of the best comedy films of all time.\n\nReally Conor S.?\nOne of the best of all time?\nI'm going to need to see that list.\nWho's Conor S.?\nIf you're unfamiliar with digital identity, and don't want to read my 15 part masterpiece on the subject, let me give you the tl;dr: Conor S. may not exist as you imagine him.\nPerhaps you read his review, and concluded he was a well-intentioned internet denizen with questionable taste in cinema, and perhaps a particular taste for plants.\nBut since this is an unverified account on the internet, he could be a she, or an overworked and underpaid worker from a country lacking labor laws, or in this day of large language models he could even be another computer.\nYou could even train a machine to believe Good Burger is in fact one of the best comedy films of all time so that for the machine, this review is objectively true.\nHow's that Philosophy of Aesthetics professors!\nRotten Tomatoes seems rather innocuous as far as spurious reviews are concerned, but what about Yelp, and Google?\nWhat incentive do either of those platforms have to display or highlight reviews from establishments that aren't paying them money?\nWhy do we trust, implicitly, the \"crowd sourced\" \"analysis\" of platforms whose whole design is pay-to-play?\nDid we ever care though?\nBack in those days of going to shows in Chicago, there was perhaps the greatest all ages venue of all time in the Fireside Bowl.\nAmerica's puritanical past enforces strict limitations on minors' ability to interface with alcohol with one notable exception: event spaces.\nWithout this exception, your first baseball game would be at 21, and wouldn't hit quite the same way.\nThanks to a history I don't care to look up, there was one kind of establishment in Chicago zoned like a stadium that wasn't a stadium, the bowling alley.\nThanks to this zoning, the Fireside Bowl was able to supply concerts to rockers of all ages, and alcohol to those that the laws of the land allowed, and thus this venue of legend was born.\nThere was a show that if you were there is certainly etched in your memory.\nThe penultimate band was a local group called Wolfeyes, and the headliner was a two piece no one had heard before called Lightning Bolt.\nI remember standing about a quarter of the way back from the stage vividly as the last chord of Wolfeyes set faded away, and was immediately cut into by the grinding dissonance that only a live show cranked up too loud can give you.\nEveryone in the crowd turned around to see Lightning Bolt.\nOne member behind a tattered bass guitar with one guitar string that was already polluting the air with the fury fitting their name, the other member bent in half atop a full-stack plus of monitors and speakers.\nOnce enough eyes were on him, he lept down to the drum throne waiting for him and joined the noise in perfect time.\nThey sold all their merch that night, and more online I'm sure, and their next show in town sold out.\nI'm pretty sure they didn't buy any ads.\nThe scale of aggregation that the internet allows gives a skewed view of what a decision point is, and how it should be made.\n\"Should I go see the Lightning Bolt?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Should I get Taco Bell when I want a burrito?\"\nYelp says yes.\nWhat do you say?\nDid we ever really care what Ebert had to say about a movie?\nMaybe, but that was easily overridden by the people whose opinion we really care about, our family and friends.\nNot only do we trust their opinion, but they know our preferences--I can gaurantee you no one that knows me is recommending Taco Bell, and Yelp is tapped into multiple spyware conglomorates I'm sure so it should know better.\nWord of mouth is king\nMarketers all over will tell you there is no substitute for word of mouth.\nIt's fundamentally where recommendations come from.\nIf they came from random reviews on the internet then that would be monetized, and not the ads that supplant them.\nSo why not incentivize that?\nWhy not let people add themselves to a transaction pipeline where they get a little piece of recommending things to their family and friends?\nBecause then if they get too noisy with their recommendations, you can tell them to shut up lol...unlike ads on the internet.\nAnd if they have the temerity of forming an opinion on something they don't have the credentials to warrant, you can ask them, \"where's your band?\"\n\n\n","id":"https://opensource-force.github.io/osf-blog/posts/wheres-your-band/","title":"Where's your
