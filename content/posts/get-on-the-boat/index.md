# Get on the boat

I remember when I was a kid, anthropologists, or whoever it is whose job it is to figure these things out, didn't "know" how people got to Hawaii.
I was like, "um...I know how they got there.
They took a boat."

Seemed pretty obvious looking at the map that that's how it had to work.
It's not like there was a bridge you know?

Many years later I was sitting at the bar with some friends, and one of them was talking about how we'd never send anyone to Mars because who would ever take that risk. 
I laughed at them, and said, "never underestimate our willingness to get on the boat."

## Head out to the job tree, and pick a job

Boats have evolved over time.
In fact, we've gotten to the point where we put them in space.
That let's them grow bigger and bigger, unfettered by the realities of bouyancy for survival.

And the biggest space ship that I think most people know about is the Death Star from Star Wars, and since I want to talk about a giant boat, I'm going to use it.

Wookiepedia tells me that there are 1.7 million space citizens on the Death Star, a big number to be sure, but still smaller than most cities that people can name.
