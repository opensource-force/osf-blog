# Get on the boat

I remember when I was a kid, anthropologists, or whoever it is whose job it is to figure these things out, didn't "know" how people got to Hawaii.
I was like, "um...I know how they got there.
They took a boat."

Seemed pretty obvious looking at the map that that's how it had to work.
It's not like there was a bridge you know?

Many years later I was sitting at the bar with some friends, and one of them was talking about how we'd never send anyone to Mars because who would ever take that risk. 
I laughed at them, and said, "never underestimate our willingness to get on the boat."

## Head out to the job tree, and pick a job

Boats have evolved over time.
In fact, we've gotten to the point where we put them in space.
That let's them grow bigger and bigger, unfettered by the realities of bouyancy for survival.

And the biggest space ship that I think most people know about is the Death Star from Star Wars, and since I want to talk about a giant boat, I'm going to use it.

Wookiepedia tells me that there are 1.7 million space citizens on the Death Star, a big number to be sure, but still smaller than most cities that people can name. 
A quora answer on big boats informs me that everyone has a job, so if we transfer that to the Death Star, we have to come up with 1.7 million jobs.
And since 1.7 million is around the population of Phoenix, the sixth largest city in the US, that's a lot of jobs.

Now just like how Galen Erso would make for an interesting dinner guest, but may not be able to speak to the intricacies of large scale kyber crystal infused mega-weapons and the intra-galactic supply chain necessary to meet imperical planet destruction schedules, the boat that is Planet Nine is a bit too large for me to explain in a single blog post. 
So the point of this post is not to tell you how boats work, or how this one in particular works. 
Instead, it's about how we put you to work if you come aboard. 

## What's our Alderaan?

Too many words to say how it all works, but I can at least tell you where we're headed. 
We're going to blow up digital advertising. 

If you want to know why, ask anyone who has lost a family member to some conspiracy theory rabbit hole fed to them by an algorithm monetized through ads.
Ask anyone whose business shuttered because they couldn't keep up with the rising cost and decreasing efficacy of Facebook ads and Google seo. 
Ask a group of teenagers why they can't agree on what happened in the world last week since their TikTok algorithms feed them different versions of reality.

And here's where the Death Star metaphor ends, because we're not going to show up and blow them all up.
No, we're going to do it the old-fashioned way: building a better mousetrap.

## So let's hear about these jobs

In general, only one or two of these will be really relevant to someone on the boat. 
If you follow the links to the Planet Nine version it'll take you to an overview of that app/project, and how the various jobs for each work. 

For the **vast majority** of people, your job is to be a user.
And being a user is super easy for whatever you want to use.
