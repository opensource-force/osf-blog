# "It's a free country"

Back in 2015 I bought a house in southeast Portland with my friend Luc. 

We had the benefit of both having gone to a small college in town called Reed.
Reed is well known for its academics, and somewhat lax approach to substance use (at least it was back in our day).
Those of us who went there are governed by the Honor Principle, an ill-defined set of rules that mostly amount to "don't be an asshole."

True to our youthful indoctrination, we drew up an agreement with provisions on what should happen if either of us got a real girlfriend, but was a bit light on what will happen financially upon sale of our joint asset. 
So when it came time to sell The Dojo, an affectionate nickname earned by the Asian decor that pre-dated our purchase, I consulted my lawyer, another Reedie, on what the legal and financial ramifications of the sale would be.
Our conversation went something like this.

Me: So what I blah blah blah like if I could just write a check blah blah.

Lawyer: Oh yeah, you can do that.

Me (flabbergasted): What do you mean? 
I can just write a check like that to him?

My lawyer smiled that smile that only lawyers smile when they've just lawyered the shit out of something, and spread his arms wide.

Lawyer: Of course! 
It's a free country.

Luc and I still cheers to the day I wrote him a six figure check, and then we went across the street to The Lutz, our alma mater's goto watering hole to celebrate.

## "Can't you just like, not do that?"

In my twenties I worked for two well-regarded gigantocorps, one involving coffee and the other named after a fruit.
Both of them, while touting how great they were for employees, were aggressively anti-union. 
Sitting in a room making $24/hr and listening to some lawyer making $300/hr tell you how the folks making $13/hr should shut up and like it so that the folks making $0/hr because they're already millionaires can make more money wouldn't be the worst place to start the revolution. 

I, of course, was already well on my way to starting The Revolution, and so my take away from that meeting was, why on Earth does every stupid company do this? 
Like, can't you just not do that?
Well it kind of turns out that you can't. 
Sort of.

It wasn't until much later in my career that I learned that corporate titles have actual meaning beyond conferring muckity muck status to mostly incompetent white men. 
For example, Directors and above in publicly traded companies have a fiduciary responsibility to the company, and thus the shareholders of that company. 
Fiduciary means acting in the financial best interest of the company.

Any fledgling day trader will tell you that making moves that are in the financial best interest of anything is more art (luck) than skill, but there is something pretty universally understood as bad for a company's bottom line: paying its workers more.
This means that by law, Directors and above at publicly traded companies must be anti-union.
Of course union busting is illegal too so the real advantage lies with the group that can employee the most lawyers to figure out what can and cannot be done.
And if you're wondering if it would just be cheaper to pay people more than employ all the lawyers needed to fight this ongoing battle just remember that if there's any group better at getting paid than unions, it's lawyers.

At the same time that this was going on at the fruit stand, as we called that fruit-named company, its stock price was rocketing up in value.
I invested the ten percent max into the employee stock purchase plan, and after two years of that I had enough to go back to school.
That whole experience got me thinking about shareholders and employees, and really what is the value to society of people with enough wealth to invest in the stock market being the only ones to benefit from it? 

Well what if the shareholders of a company weren't rich people, but rather, like, not rich people?
I thought I had come up with something novel, but it turns out the idea's been around for a while.
They're called cooperatives, and the oldest one still around in the US was started by a guy named Ben Franklin. 

## Can't we all just get along?

Chances are, if you're in the US, your introduction to cooperatives has been through tiny grocery stores with a bit of something for every restrictive diet in existence. 
These are great, but there's actually a much more common cooperative, and those are credit unions. 

Not only are credit unions more common in the US than other coops, but they're actually pretty common around the world. 
That makes sense since it's actually pretty hard to make money as a bank unless you're serving people who have a bunch of money, and a bunch of money is not something all that many people on Earth has.

One of the interesting things about US corporate law is that corporations are very easy to own a piece of.
Unlike moving money around, shares in a company can be owned and traded without a whole lot of problems. 
This cavalier attitude towards the shared ownership of a corporate structures extends to cooperatives. 

## Did you know you can just not do that?

If you've never worked for an early stage company, I'd imagine you probably aren't too familiar with how a cap table works. 

In the early days of a company, before it starts making money, people work for under market value and a piece of the pie. 
The conceit is that, should the company be successful, the piece plus salary should exceed what you would've made had you worked a regular job. 

Competing for these pieces then are all these employees, the investors, and the founders of the company, each of whom have an incentive for their pieces to stay as big as possible. 
No startup I've ever worked for has shown me the cap table, but I'll vouch for the fact that when it works, it's not the worst way to make a buck. 

I bring this up to talk about the bajillionairs of our era.
Bezos, for example, owned nearly 50% of Amazon when it IPOed back in 1997. 
This ownership is where the majority of his wealth comes from.

The promise of capitalism is that.
Not that you'll get paid a lot, but rather that you make something so valuable that you become a gajillionaire because of it. 
I'm sure we all have our opinions on the morality of this, but you can hardly argue with the efficacy.
There's a seemingly endless supply of greedy dickheads trying to become billionaires too.

But did you know, and this was kind of surprising to me when I first started looking into it, that you don't have to be a greedy dickhead?
There is no fiduciary responsibility to yourself.
You do not need to hold on to your equity like Smaug buried deep in the Lonely Mountain hoarding his horde.

What would happen if someone made Amazon, but gave that near 50% out to the employees and then users of Amazon?
I don't really know, but it kind of feels like it's worth finding out. 

Considering this model of capital investiture is so ubiquitous, you might be wondering if there's some sort of legal requirement for things to be done this way. 
Like is there some analog to the fiduciary requirement for corporate directors that makes it so founding executives have to be greedy dickheads.
To be honest, that does sound like something the US might do.

It turns out that there is no law saying you need to be a greedy dickhead. 
People just do it because they can.

## Do we need them, or do they need us?

I had the wonderful good fortune of getting into punk rock as a teenager in the Chicagoland area in the late 90s. 
Thus my class consciousness was awakened through reading the liner notes of bands like Dillinger Four, and The Broadways. 

Amongst all of the veritable jams from that time, [We'll Have a Party][party] by The Broadways (Brendan Kelly and Chris McCaughan of The Lawrence Arms' Yardbirds) became my life's ballad over time. 
A love story put on hold as the system is torn down. 
Every line is gold, provoking thought and consideration of just how ludicrous and desperate the system can be. 
Go listen. 
I'll wait.

Here's the stanza for this post:

> The bosses learned to fool the slaves into 8 hour days
But do we need them or do they need us?
Seems like we dwell on these useless things, lifestyles of wealth, pursuit of money
Competition says to beat each other down for personal gain

Does the fruit stand sell iPods if we all quit? 
Of course.
Does my first startup sell transit tickets without even one member of the people who took a pay cut to keep the company going? 
Maybe...

Is the equity payout for the founders justified at 10 times that of early employees?
What about 100 times that?

Keynes in the riveting (/s) General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, points out that the Classical Economic notion that Labor negotiates for real wages based on its productivity is undermined by the fact that Labor has to negotiate for actual real world wages that, you know, let you buy food and stuff.

The more well-known Marx had already pointed out that Labor was getting stiffed out of the fruits of its labor since profit was going to the bosses instead of to themselves. 

So in a capitalist society, the pressure from the bosses is to get you coming and going.
Labor is underpaid, and then the profit garnered from that injustice is spread amongst the already wealthy. 
And for a few centuries now, the goal we've been sold on is joining their club, and not marching them to the guillotines.

Back to my first startup, and someone leaving. 
Does Bezos' life change all that much if his 50% becomes 48% because he had to spend a bit more to retain someone, or replace someone?
How much does your life change if tomorrow you stopped getting paid?

That's the inequality in entrepreneurialship.
Bezos has to roll the dice on have a few less billion than all his billions.
You have to roll the dice on whether you get to afford food next week.

Seems like we need them more than they need us.

## Robin Hood is an app for Wall Street Bros

The whole lose your job, and immediately become destitute is the reason why some countries have strong social safety nets.
We here in the US do not.
Whether we should or not is certainly something people will debate, but I won't debate it here.
Instead I'll just say, whereever you stand on the issue, we're unlikely to all be able to quit our jobs with government help in the next few years.

So, in order to combat the gap between Bezos' 50%, and you not being able to buy groceries if he fires you, it's worth trying to figure something else out.
For pretty much anyone whose ever had to supplement their income, we already know what that something is: you get a second job. 
You know what sucks?
Getting a second job.
Let's see if we can make it a little better. 

I think [this article from 80k hours][80000] gives a nice overview of what to look for in a job.

* Work that's engaging
* Work that helps others
* Work you're good at
* Work with supportive colleagues
* Work that doesn't have major negatives
* Work that fits with the rest of your life

Well I don't know about you, but that sounds like doing whatever it is you do with your friends to me. 
I wonder if there's something we could be doing to get paid there.

Every summer Games Done Quick puts on a week long marathon of video game speed runs. 
There is a t-shirt company specializing in video game and fantasy-themed apparel.
Throughout the marathon they make sizable donations to support the runners, and the group they're raising money for which is typically Doctors Without Borders.

Those donations are marketing of course, but I'd rather $10k go to Doctors Without Borders than Zuckerberg's island ruination fund.
Now we have a nice little loop: The Yetee donates to market -> speed runners volunteer their time to give this platform -> people buy from The Yetee -> repeat.
The platform is what makes the big donation worthwhile at a marketing tool.
But what if we didn't need the platform?

The whole ecosystem of this speed running marathon is repeated all over the Earth in the hobbies and passions that we share with our friends. 
They are what's engaging, and what we're good at, and by golly when you tell someone to purchase some super esoteric piece of essential paraphenelia, you should get a buck or two if they buy it.
