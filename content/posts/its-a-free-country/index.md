# "It's a free country"

Back in 2015 I bought a house in southeast Portland with my friend Luc. 

We had the benefit of both having gone to a small college in town called Reed.
Reed is well known for its academics, and somewhat lax approach to substance use (at least it was back in our day).
Those of us who went there are governed by the Honor Principle, an ill-defined set of rules that mostly amount to "don't be an asshole."

True to our youthful indoctrination, we drew up an agreement with provisions on what should happen if either of us got a real girlfriend, but was a bit light on what will happen financially upon sale of our joint asset. 
So when it came time to sell The Dojo, an affectionate nickname earned by the Asian decor that pre-dated our purchase, I consulted my lawyer, another Reedie, on what the legal and financial ramifications of the sale would be.
Our conversation went something like this.

Me: So what I blah blah blah like if I could just write a check blah blah.

Lawyer: Oh yeah, you can do that.

Me (flabbergasted): What do you mean? 
I can just write a check like that to him?

My lawyer smiled that smile that only lawyers smile when they've just lawyered the shit out of something, and spread his arms wide.

Lawyer: Of course! 
It's a free country.

Luc and I still cheers to the day I wrote him a six figure check, and then we went across the street to The Lutz, our alma mater's goto watering hole to celebrate.

## "Can't you just like, not do that?"

In my twenties I worked for two well-regarded gigantocorps, one involving coffee and the other named after a fruit.
Both of them, while touting how great they were for employees, were aggressively anti-union. 
Sitting in a room making $24/hr and listening to some lawyer making $300/hr tell you how the folks making $13/hr should shut up and like it so that the folks making $0/hr because they're already millionaires can make more money wouldn't be the worst place to start the revolution. 

I, of course, was already well on my way to starting The Revolution, and so my take away from that meeting was, why on Earth does every stupid company do this? 
Like, can't you just not do that?
Well it kind of turns out that you can't. 
Sort of.

It wasn't until much later in my career that I learned that corporate titles have actual meaning beyond conferring muckity muck status to mostly incompetent white men. 
For example, Directors and above in publicly traded companies have a fiduciary responsibility to the company, and thus the shareholders of that company. 
Fiduciary means acting in the financial best interest of the company.

Any fledgling day trader will tell you that making moves that are in the financial best interest of anything is more art (luck) than skill, but there is something pretty universally understood as bad for a company's bottom line: paying its workers more.
This means that by law, Directors and above at publicly traded companies must be anti-union.
Of course union busting is illegal too so the real advantage lies with the group that can employee the most lawyers to figure out what can and cannot be done.
And if you're wondering if it would just be cheaper to pay people more than employ all the lawyers needed to fight this ongoing battle just remember that if there's any group better at getting paid than unions, it's lawyers.

At the same time that this was going on at the fruit stand, as we called that fruit-named company, its stock price was rocketing up in value.
I invested the ten percent max into the employee stock purchase plan, and after two years of that I had enough to go back to school.
That whole experience got me thinking about shareholders and employees, and really what is the value to society of people with enough wealth to invest in the stock market being the only ones to benefit from it?
