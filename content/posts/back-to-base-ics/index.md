# What's in a name?

Ursula K. Le Guin's fantastic A Wizard of Earthsea creates a world of magic where the greatest power one can hold over a person or thing is knowledge of its true name.
A friend of mine and I were lamenting that we never had the opportunity to run in to Le Guin while we were all in Portland (he's a big deal enough that this was a possibility, I am not). 
He also shared with me her essay on [The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction][carrier-bag].

Those of you familiar with Planet Nine's lore will know that boats feature quite heavily. 
Boats have two properties that make them useful: they float, and they carry things from here to there. 
If we relax our definition of floating to include being carried, I hope you'll indulge me in acknowledging that the carrier bag, and the boat have much in common.

(I'd like to note too that Le Guinn acknowledges the importance of stacks in her essay, "home being another, larger
kind of pouch or bag, a container for people." 
Anyone who has been drinking with me as I try to explain stacks and boats will recognize this flexibility in terminology)

The gist of the theory, which comes from Elizabeth Fisher's Carrier Bag Theory of Human Evolution, is that though bags [and boats] are essential to humans, so much so that they were likely our earliest tool, they don't fit in well with the conflict-driven hero narratives of modern fiction.
Hero worship is not just in fiction, but I would say permeates all of popular culture in the United States. 
Whether quarterback, or diva, or pedophile-turned-president, whereas carrier bags are things you get when you donate twenty bucks to PBS, which normally you wouldn't do, but now you have to because of that stupid president.

Le Guin writes in her essay:

> One relationship among elements in the novel may well be that of
conflict, but the reduction of narrative to conflict is absurd. (I have
read a how-to-write manual that said, "A story should be seen as a
battle," and went on about strategies, attacks, victory, etc.) Conflict,
competition, stress, struggle, etc., within the narrative conceived as
carrier bag I belly I box I house I medicine bundle, may be seen as
necessary elements of a whole which itself cannot be characterized
either as conflict or as harmony, since its purpose is neither resolu-
tion nor stasis but continuing process.

> Finally, it's clear that the Hero does not look well in this bag. He
needs a stage or a pedestal or a pinnacle. You put him in a bag and
he looks like a rabbit, like a potato.

This notion of narrative as a _continuing_ process is intriguing. 
Aren't stories, by definition, in possession of an ending? 
But robbed of the need for resolution, why not just go on and on?

People haven't been writing computer programs nearly as long as we've been writing stories so we don't really know what we're doing yet, and it's probably unfair to map the latter to the former. 
But I don't think it's too far afield to say that the world of Facebook and Google has it's own hero-fetish that might not be the greatest when the story doesn't end. 
"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain," Harvey Dent was on to something.

If the gigantocorps are our heroes, constantly on stage peacocking about like the world owes them for their benevolence, what's the carrier bag for tech?
On Earthsea we would only have to speak its name to avail ourselves of its power.
Here on plain old Earth we need that name, and then we have to build it. 

We have an idea of what it might be.

We call it a **base**.

##  





> So the Hero has decreed through his mouthpieces the
Lawgivers, first, that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the
arrmv or spear, starting heTe and going straight there and THOK!
hitting its mark (which drops dead); second, that the central con-
cern of narrative, including the novel, is conflict; and third, that the
story isn't any good if he isn't in it.
